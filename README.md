## Installation

1. Download / clone the repository.

2. Satisfy the following requirements:

    - Python 3.X
    - Set up a virtual env with requirements:
        - `python3 -m venv venv`
        - `source venv/bin/activate`
        - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    
3. [Register](https://account.withings.com/partner/add_oauth2) an application with Nokia Health and obtain a consumer key and secret.
    1. logo: the requirements are quite strict, [feel free to use this one](https://github.com/magnific0/nokia-weight-sync/blob/master/logo256w.png)
    1. callback: you can pick anything, but if you want to do the automated authorization (you will be prompted for this), you need to pick the hostname/ip and port carefully. For example http://localhost:8087.
        - localhost: if you run nokia-weight-sync and do the authorization in the browser on the same device. This needs to be replaced by local or public ip/hostname if you run it on a server.
        - 8087: a port that is likely not used by other services. For a remote setup make sure the port is not firewalled.
        - http: https is available, but requires additional setup of certificates. For localhost http is fine.

## Usage

1. On first run you need to set-up your Nokia Health consumer key and secret:

        ./nokia-weight-sync.py -k CONSUMER_KEY -s CONSUMER_SECRET setup nokia
        
2. Follow the instructions on the screen and verify the application.

3. Register one or more destination services:

    - **Garmin Connect:** register your Garmin Connect credentials and sync your last measurement (provide GC password when asked):

            ./nokia-weight-sync.py -k user@example.com setup garmin
            
    - **Smashrun (implicit flow, recommended):** for user level authentication simply copy the access token (no registration, no refresh after expiry):
    
            ./nokia-weight-sync.py setup smashrun
            
    - **Smashrun (code flow):** register Smashrun API application keys and follow the authorization process to obtain your users refresh_token ([registration required](https://api.smashrun.com/register), refresh after expiry):
    
            ./nokia-weight-sync.py -k CLIENT_ID -s CLIENT_SECRET setup smashrun_code
            
4. Verify that the relevant sections for the services are added to ```config.ini```.
        
5. Synchronize (new) measurements:

        ./nokia-weight-sync.py sync garmin
        ./nokia-weight-sync.py sync smashrun
        
**Important** Nokia Health API, Smashrun API, and Garmin Connect credentials are stored in ```config.ini```. If this file is compromised your Garmin Connect account, personal health data from Nokia Health, and activity data from Smashrun are at risk.
